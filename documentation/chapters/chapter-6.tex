\chapter{Conclusion}
This research shows how Vose's haploid model for Genetic Algorithms
extends to the diploid case, improving the computation of infinite
population evolutionary trajectories by significantly reducing the
time and space used.  Efficiency is achieved through decoupling
haploid evolution from the evolution of infinite diploid populations
and employing Walsh transform methods to compute the effects of
mask-based crossover and mutation.  

Simulations are thereby made feasible which otherwise would require
excessive resources, as illustrated through computations exploring 
the convergence rate of finite population short-term behavior to infinite population evolutionary trajectories. 
Results confirm that distance can be inversely proportional to the square root of population size.

Simulations showed that when the necessary condition for oscillation in infinite populations is met, 
finite populations also exhibit approximate oscillation. Amplitude of oscillation increases with 
increase in population size, and larger population exhibit better oscillation. Also amplitude of 
oscillation decreases with increase in genome length.

When the condition for inifinite population oscillation is violated for the mutation distribution, 
we showed that the Markov chain representing finite population evolution is regular, and hence, 
perfect oscillation should not occur. However, simulation results showed 
infinite populations ceases to oscillate, 
but finite populations continue to approximately oscillate if the violation is small. 

When the condition is violated for crossover distribution,
we could not show that Markov chain formed is regular, 
but results showed finite populations continue to approximately oscillate 
when the violation is small, and ceases to oscillate when the violation is larger. 
As genome length increases oscillation in population degrades. 
Moreover, larger population shows better oscillation 
as in the case of oscillation without violation.

In this research, we did consider only one plane fitness function (uniform fitness function) for selection.  
In future, we plan to extend our work by accomodating different fitness function in our model and investigate 
the influence of that change upon the results obtained in the absence of selective pressure.
