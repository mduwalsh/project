\chapter{Violation in Crossover Distribution} \label{ch:chiviolation}
The results from chapter \ref{ch:muviolation} show robustness of finite population oscillation 
demonstrating approximate oscillation can take place in finite populations 
when the mutation distribution $\bm{\mu}$ violates condition \ref{OscCond} .  
This chapter explores the robustness of finite population oscillation when condition \ref{OscCond} 
for the crossover distribution $\bm{\chi}$ is violated.
Violation of the condition, crossover-violation, as we call it, is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\text{For all} \;g\;, \,g \neq 0, \quad \quad \quad
\label{chi-violation}
  1 \neq \sum \limits_{k \in \bar{g}\mathcal{R}} \bm{\chi}_{k+g} + \bm{\chi}_k  
\end{equation}
The question explored in this chapter is: Can finite populations exhibit approximate oscillation when there is violation in $\bm{\chi}$ 
and infinite population trajectories
have no periodic orbit?

Error $\bm{\epsilon}$ is introduced into the crossover distribution $\bm{\chi}$ so as to 
violate condition \ref{OscCond}; this guarantees that 
infinite population trajectories have no periodic orbit. Consequently, $\bm{p}^\ast \;=\; \bm{q}^\ast \;=\; \bm{z}^\ast$. 
Going forward, we use `limit $\bm{z}^\ast$' to denote evolutionary limit when crossover distribution 
$\bm{\chi}$ violates condition \ref{OscCond}, and 
`non-violation limits $\bm{p}^\ast$ and $\bm{q}^\ast$' to denote limits without violations (i.e., $\bm{\epsilon \,=\, 0}$).

\section{Violation}
The crossover distribution $\bm{\chi}$ was modified as 
\begin{equation*}
\bm{\chi}_i = (1-\bm{\epsilon}) \bm{\chi}_i \quad \quad
\text{so that } \quad \quad \quad \sum \bm{\chi}_i + \bm{\chi}_{i+g} = 1-\bm{\epsilon}  
\end{equation*}  
Then a single $j$ is chosen where $j \not\in \bar{g}\mathcal{R}$ and set $\bm{\chi}_j = \bm{\epsilon}$. 

Violation in crossover distribution $\bm{\chi}$ is different from violation in mutation distribution $\bm{\mu}$. 
The Markov chain formed by transition matrix $Q$ is regular under violation in $\bm{\mu}$ 
but that need not be the case under violation in  $\bm{\chi}$. 
The initial population is 
computed using the same procedure as described in section \ref{InitPopOsc}. To explore the effects of the degree  
of violation of condition \ref{OscCond} in $\bm{\chi}$, different values of $\bm{\epsilon} \in \{0.01, 0.1, 0.5\} $ are used in experiments. 
String length $\ell \;\in\; \{8, 10, 12, 14\}$ is considered for simulation.
The distances of both infinite and finite populations to limit $\bm{z}^\ast$ are plotted. 
The distances of both infinite and finite populations to 
non-violation limits $\bm{p}^\ast$ and $\bm{q}^\ast$ (i.e. $\bm{\epsilon} = 0$) are also plotted.

\section{Discussion}
In the presence of violation in $\bm{\mu}$, the amplitude of oscillation decreases 
as string length $\ell$ increases. 
Larger population sizes show better oscillation. 
Since diploid populations have effective string length twice the size of haploid populations, 
diploid populations need larger population size than haploid population to exhibit good oscillation. 
As in the case of violation in $\bm{\mu}$, increasing string length $\ell$ 
degrades convergence (as finite population size increases) to infinite population behavior for diploid populations. 
That behavior is noticeable in figures 
\ref{oscillation_8d_vio_chi_0.01} through \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_chi_0.5} for violation in $\bm{\chi}$. 
That behavior is less noticeable in haploid populations.

With increase in the value of $\bm{\epsilon}$, 
oscillation in population diminishes and dampening of oscillation increases. 
Randomness increases with increasing $\bm{\epsilon}$.
Comparing oscillation with violation in $\bm{\mu}$ and $\bm{\chi}$, rate of dampening of oscillation with violation 
in $\bm{\chi}$ seems to be slower than with violation in ${\bm{\mu}}$. 
Diploid populations jumping to other levels 
were observed for string lengths 12 and 14 and population size 4096  ( 
figures \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_chi_0.01}, \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_chi_0.01}, \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_chi_0.1}, 
\ref{oscillation_14d_vio_chi_0.1}, \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_chi_0.5} and \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_chi_0.5}), 
but unlike the case of violation in $\bm{\mu}$, 
the behavior is noticeable when the population size is larger (figure \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_chi_0.1}). 

% As in $\bm{\mu}$ violation, we noticed similar unexpected behavior also in presence of violation in $\bm{\chi}$: 
% figures \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_chi_0.5} and \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_chi_0.5} 
% show that the lines representing distance of population to limits $\bm{p}^\ast$ and $\bm{q}^\ast$ overlap. 
% The graphs suggest that finite population evolution is exploring a plane equidistant from $\bm{p}^\ast$ and $\bm{q}^\ast$.

% Moreover, in figures \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_chi_0.1} and \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_chi_0.1}, infinite population oscillation dies out to 
% give graph of single line. But infinite population is converging to limit $\bm{z}^\ast$. 
% This suggests $\bm{z}^\ast$ may be somewhere in equidistant plane from $\bm{p}^\ast$ and $\bm{q}^\ast$.

Figure \ref{vio_chi_dist} summarizes the distance data from tables \ref{distanceChiHapEps0.01} through 
\ref{distanceChiDipEps0.5}. Distance between infinite and finite populations 
for population sizes {4096, 40960, 81920} are plotted for different $\ell$. 
Plots for different violation levels $\bm{\epsilon}$ are arranged in columns. 
Plots for haploid and diploid populations are arranged in two rows. With increase in $\ell$, 
distance between finite and infinite population moves closer to the single step distance. So, since diploid effective population 
string length is twice that of haploid population, 
distance in diploid case moves closer to the single step distance for the same value of $\ell$ than in haploid case. 
Like in the case of $\bm{\mu}$ violation, it is more noticeable in haploid population case that as $\bm{\epsilon}$ increases, 
the distance moves closer to the single step distance.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we violated condition \ref{OscCond} for the crossover distribution, 
so that infinite population trajectories have no periodic orbit. 
We explored infinite and finite population oscillation behavior with the violation through experiments. 
We don't know if the Markov chain is regular in this case but we suspect it is not.  
Like in case of $\bm{\mu}$ violation, infinite population oscillation dies out when condition \ref{OscCond} for convergence to 
periodic orbits is violated, but finite populations approximately oscillate for small values of $\bm{\epsilon}$ 
because the probability of using the new mask is low, and not used, 
finite population follows behavior of infinite population without violation in the condition for convergence to 
periodic orbits. However, rate of dampening of oscillation with violation 
in $\bm{\chi}$ is observed to be slower than with violation in ${\bm{\mu}}$. Also more randomness in oscillations are observed 
in this case than in violation in mutation, especially for diploid population.
