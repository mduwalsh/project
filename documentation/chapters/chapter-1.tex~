\section{Random Heuristic Search}
Vose \cite{Vose1999} introduced abstract model, a generalized heuristic search method referred to as {\em Random Heuristic Search (RHS)} which is defined upon the central concept of state and transition between states. An instance of {\em RHS} can be thought of as an initial collection of elements $P_0$ chosen from some search space $\Omega$ , together with a stochastic transition rule $\tau$ , which from $P_i$ will produce another collection $P_{i+1}$. In other words, $\tau$ will be iterated to produce a sequence of generations.

The beginning collection $P_0$ is referred to as the {\em initial population}. Let $n$ be the cardinality of $\Omega$. The {\em simplex} is defined to be the set of population descriptors:

\[
\Lambda = {\langle x_0,...,x_{n-1} \rangle : \b{1}^T x=1, x+j \geq 0 }
\]

An element $p$ of $\Lambda$ corresponds to a population according to the rule:

$p_j$ = the proportion in the population of the $j$th element of $\Omega$

The cardinality of each population is a constant $r$, called the population size. Given $r$, a population descriptor $p$ unambiguously determines a population.

Given the current population vector $p$, the next population vector $\tau(p)$ cannot be predicted with certainty because $\tau$ is stochastic 
and results from $r$ independent, identically distributed random choices. Let $G:\Lambda \rightarrow \Lambda$ be a function that given the current population vector $p$ produces a new vector whose $i$th component is the probability that $i$th element of $\Omega$ is chosen. Thus, $G(p)$ is the probability vector that specifies the distribution from which the aggregate of $r$ choices forms the subsequent generation.
Vose \cite{Vose1999} computes probability that population $q \in \frac{1}{r} X_n^r$ given current population vector $p$ as 
\[
r! \prod \frac{(G(p)_j)^{rq_j}}{(rq_j)!}
\]
\[
 = exp{-r \sum q_j \ln \frac{q_j}{G(p)!} - \sum (\ln \sqrt{2 \pi rq_j} + \frac{1}{12rq_j + \theta (rq_j)}) + O(\ln r)}
\]
where summation is restricted to indices for which $q_j > 0$ and $\frac{1}{r} X_n^r$ is set of possible populations.

Each random vector in the sequence $p, \tau(p), \tau^2(p),...$ depends only on the value of the preceding one, which is a special situation, and such a sequence form a Markov chain with
transition matrix
\[
Q_{p,q} = r! \prod \frac{(G(p)_j)^{rq_j}}{(rq_j)!}
\]
So the conceptualization of RHS can be replaced by Markov chain model abstraction which makes no reference to sampling $\Omega$. That is from current population $p$, produce $q = \tau (p)$ with probability $Q_{p,q}$. With transition matrix defined for Markov chain model, Vose \cite{Vose1999} says the expected next generation $E(\tau (p))$ is $G(p)$ and the expression in transition matrix
\[
\sum q_j \ln \frac{q_j}{G(p)!}
\]
gives the qualitative information regarding probable next generation which is the {\em discrepancy} of $q$ with respect to $G(p)$. It is a measure of how far $q$ is from the expected next population $G(p)$. Discrepancy is nonnegative and is zero only when $q$ is the expected next population. Hence the factor 
\[
exp{-r \sum q_j \ln \frac{q_j}{G(p)!}}
\]
in the expression of transition matrix indicates the probability that $q$ is the next generation
decays exponentially, with constant $r$ , as the discrepancy between $q$ and the
expected next population increases.
The expression 
\[
\sum (\ln \sqrt{2 \pi rq_j} + \frac{1}{12rq_j + \theta (rq_j)})
\]
measures the {\em dispersion} of the population vector $q$ and the factor
\[
exp{- \sum (\ln \sqrt{2 \pi rq_j} + \frac{1}{12rq_j + \theta (rq_j)})}
\]
indicates the probability that $q$ is the next generation decays exponentially with increasing dispersion.

Vose \cite{Vose1999} calculated variance of next generation population with respect to expected population as 
\[
E(\| \tau (p) - G(p) \|^2) = (1 - \|G(p)\|^2) / r)
\]
and mentioned $\tau (p)$ converges in probability to $G(p)$ as the population size increases. Therefore, corresponds to G in the infinite
population case.
