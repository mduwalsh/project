% Genetic algorithm has been used to evolve solutions to problems not yielding to other known methods. 
% It has been analyzed and developed over time. Relationship between finite population and infinite population models 
% has been explored. Vose's infinite haploid population model in Random Heuristic Search suggests the distance between 
% finite population and infinite population might decrease by square root of finite population size. 

% This research investigates, as our first question, through experiment if this rate of decrease of distance is exhibited in practice.
An infinite population model is considered for diploid evolution under the influence of crossing over
and mutation. The evolution equations show how Vose's 
haploid model for Genetic Algorithms extends to the diploid case, thereby making feasible simulations
which otherwise would require excessive resources. This is illustrated through computations confirming
the convergence of finite diploid population short-term behaviour to the behaviour predicted by the
infinite diploid model. The results show the distance between finite and infinite population evolutionary trajectories can 
decrease in practice like the reciprocal of the square root of population size. 

Infinite populations show oscillating behavior under 
some circumstances. We explore whether finite populations can also exhibit oscillation or approximate oscillation. 
% This is explored as our second research question. Conditions in crossing over and mutation projected 
% by Vose for infinite population to oscillate in periodic orbits were implemented for finite 
% population, and 
Simulation results confirm that approximate finite population oscillation is possible. 

We also investigate the robustness of finite population oscillation.  
We showed how the Markov chain 
formed by transition matrix in presence of violation becomes regular, and perfect oscillation should not occur for population. 
However, our simulation results show finite population exhibit approximate oscillating behavior even though the condition is violated.
