\chapter{Conclusion}
This research shows how Vose's haploid model for Genetic Algorithms
extends to the diploid case, improving the computation of infinite
population evolutionary trajectories by significantly reducing the
time and space used.  Efficiency is achieved through decoupling
haploid evolution from the evolution of infinite diploid populations
and employing Walsh transform methods to compute the effects of
mask-based crossover and mutation.  

Simulations are thereby made feasible which otherwise would require
excessive resources, as illustrated through computations exploring 
the convergence rate of finite population short-term behavior to infinite population evolutionary trajectories. 
Results confirm that distance can be inversely proportional to the square root of population size.

Simulations showed that when the necessary condition for oscillation in infinite populations is met, 
finite populations also exhibit approximate oscillation, converging to 
infinite population evolutionary limits in the short term. Amplitude of oscillation increases with 
increase in population size, and larger population exhibit better oscillation. Also amplitude of 
oscillation decreases with increase in genome length $\ell$.

When the condition is violated for mutation distribution, we showed that Markov chain formed is 
regular, and hence, oscillation should not occur. However, simulation results showed 
infinite populations ceases to oscillate, but finite populations may continue to oscillate if the violation is small. 
When the condition is violated for crossover distribution, we could not show that Markov chain formed is regular, 
but results showed finite populations continue to oscillate if the violation is small. As genome length increases 
oscillation in population degrades. And larger population shows better oscillation 
like in case of oscillation without violation.

In this research, for simplicity we did not consider fitness factor for selection.  
In future, we plan to extend our work by accomodating fitness factor in our model and investigate 
the influence of that change upon the results obtained in the absence of selective pressure.
