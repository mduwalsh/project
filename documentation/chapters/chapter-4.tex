\chapter{Violation in Mutation Distribution} \label{ch:muviolation}
The results from chapter \ref{ch:oscillation} show that oscillation occurs
when the crossover distribution $\bm{\chi}$ and the mutation distribution $\bm{\mu}$ 
satisfy condition \ref{OscCond}. This chapter explores the robustness of 
finite population oscillation when condition \ref{OscCond} is violated for $\bm{\mu}$. 
The violation of the condition \ref{OscCond} prevents 
infinite population convergence to a periodic orbit. 
Violation of the condition \ref{OscCond} for $\bm{\mu}$, mutation-violation as we call it, 
is expressed as:  
\begin{equation}
\label{mu-violation}
 \text{For all} \;g\;, \,g \neq 0, \quad \quad \quad
 -1 \neq \sum \limits_{j} (-1)^{g^T j} \bm{\mu}_j  
\end{equation}
Mutation-violation also makes 
the Markov chain representing finite population evolution regular 
(sometimes called ergodic). If the Markov chain is regular, 
then positive steady state distribution exists for the Markov chain, 
no finite population periodic orbit exists, 
and perfect finite population oscillation can not occur. 
The question explored in this chapter is: Can finite populations exhibit approximate oscillation when the
Markov chain is regular and infinite population trajectories
have no periodic orbit?

Error $\bm{\epsilon}$ is introduced into the mutation distribution $\bm{\mu}$ so as to 
violate condition \ref{OscCond}; this guarantees that 
infinite population trajectories have no periodic orbit. Consequently, $\bm{p}^\ast \;=\; \bm{q}^\ast \;=\; \bm{z}^\ast$. 
Going forward, we use `limit $\bm{z}^\ast$' to denote evolutionary limit when mutation distribution $\bm{\mu}$ 
violates condition \ref{OscCond}, and 
`non-violation limits $\bm{p}^\ast$ and $\bm{q}^\ast$' to denote limits without violation (i.e., $\bm{\epsilon} \;=\; 0$).

\section{Violation}
The mutation distribution $\bm{\mu}$ is modified as follows
\[
\bm{\mu}_i := (1-\bm{\epsilon}) \bm{\mu}_i \nudge\;; \tabspace i = \{0, 1, 2,.., 2^{\ell}-1\}
\]
Thus summing components of $\bm{\mu}$ distribution yields, 
\[
1-\bm{\epsilon} = \sum \limits_{i=0}^{2^{\ell}-1} \bm{\mu}_i
\]
Then set
\[
\bm{\mu}_0 = \bm{\epsilon}
\]
% \[
% \bm{\mu}_0 = (1-\bm{\epsilon})\bm{\epsilon}
% \]
% $c$ is total number components in $\bm{\mu}$ satisfying condition $\bm{\mu}_i = 0$ and set those components value as
% \[
% \bm{\mu}_i = \bm{\epsilon}^2/c \; ; \; where \; \bm{\mu}_i = 0
% \]
The modified mutation distribution $\bm{\mu}$ is normalized such that  $\sum \bm{\mu}_i \;=\; 1$.
The new $\bm{\mu}$ satisfies condition \ref{mu-violation}. 
Moreover, the no mutation event (using mask $0$) has positive probability ($\bm{\mu}_0 = \bm{\epsilon} > 0$).

The modification described above makes it possible for any population member to mutate to any other population member.
% provided there is non crossover. From equation \ref{ChiDist}, $k \bar{g} \;=\; k$ is true for any $g$ when $k$ is all $0$s, 
% and so we have positive non crossover probability present in all conditions. 
Let us exlore for two cases of $g$ in \ref{OscCond}:

1. When $g$ is all $1$s:\newline
Any mask with a $1$ at position $k$ ($0 \leq k < \ell$) and $0$ at all other positions can mutate the $k$th bit, and since the 
all $0$s mask has positive probability, strings have an option to not mutate. This makes possibile for any string to mutate to 
any other string. Let us take an example with $\ell \;=\; 8$. Let $g \;=\; 11111111$. Then, mask 
$i \;=\; 00000100$ will have positive probability according to condition \ref{OscCond}. 
Mask $i$ can be used to mutate the sixth bit of a population member. More generally, 
any bit has the option of mutating or not, so any string can mutate to any other.

2. When $g$ has at least one $0$:\newline
Any mask with a $1$ at position $k$ and $0$ at all other positions  
will have positive probability if $g$ also is $1$ at position $k$. Thus, any bit where $g$ is $1$ has the option of mutating or not.  
Any mask with $1$ in just one of the positions where $g$ has $1$s and also $1$ in just one of the positions where $g$ has $0$s can be used to 
mutate a bit where $g$ is $0$. Let us take an example with $\ell \;=\; 8$. Let $g \;=\; 11001111$. Then, 
mask $i \;=\; 00000100$ will have positive probability according to condition \ref{OscCond}. Also mask 
$j \;=\; 00010100$ will have positive probability. Mask $i$ can be used to mutate the sixth bit, 
and mutation with mask $i$ followed by mutation with mask $j$ will result in mutating
the fourth bit. More generally, any bit has the option of mutating or not, 
so any string can mutate to any other. Since any population can therefore 
mutate to any other population (this may involve many generations because 
there are many population members which may need to be mutated), the Markov 
chain is irreducible.

The Markov chain is also aperiodic. We prove this by simple induction. 
Let $S(n)$ be the assertion that population $P$ can be returned to in $n$ generations. 
Our base case is $n \;=\; 1$. The GA can stay in its original state $P$ if no mutation or crossover events occur. 
Population $P$ has option to not mutate to any other population, since all $0$s mutation mask 
has positive probability.
So $S(n)$ is true. Now assume $S(k)$ is true, population $P$ can be returned to in $n \;= \;k$ generations. 
In the $k+1$th generation, population $P$ has the option to stay in state $P$. 
So $S(k+1)$ is also trueand that completes the inductive proof. 
Since any population state can be returned to in any period of time, the Markov chain is aperiodic. 

Because the Markov chain formed by GA after violation in $\bm{\mu}$ is irreducible and aperiodic, 
the Markov chain is regular (see \cite{Iosifescu1980}), and a steady state distribution 
with positive components exists for the GA (see \cite{Minc1988}).   

Simulations were repeated with mutation-violation described above. 
The initial population is 
computed using same procedure as described in section \ref{InitPopOsc}. To explore the effects of the degree  
of violation, different values of $\bm{\epsilon} \in \{0.01, 0.1, 0.5\} $ are used in experiments. 
String lengths $\ell \;\in\; \{8, 10, 12, 14\}$ are considered for simulation.
The distances of both infinite and finite populations to limit $\bm{z}^\ast$ were plotted. 
The distances of both infinite and finite populations to non-violation limits 
$\bm{p}^\ast$ and $\bm{q}^\ast$ (i.e. $\bm{\epsilon} = 0$) were also plotted.

\section{Discussion}
The previous graphs indicate that as value of $\ell$ increases, 
amplitude of oscillation decreases, and randomness in oscillation increases. 
Populations with larger population size show better oscillations. 
Since a diploid population has an effective string length twice the string length of a hapliod, 
diploid populations need larger population size to exhibit good oscillation. 
For diploid populations, increasing string length $\ell$ 
degrades convergence (as population size increases) to infinite population behavior. 
That is noticeable in figures 
\ref{oscillation_8d_vio_mu_0.01} through \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_mu_0.1} for violation in $\bm{\mu}$. 
Such behavior is less noticeable in haploid populations. 

With increasing $\bm{\epsilon}$, oscillation diminishes.  
As observed in chapter \ref{ch:oscillation}, diploid populations hop to various levels 
(in figures \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_mu_0.01}, \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_mu_0.01}, \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_mu_0.1}, 
\ref{oscillation_14d_vio_mu_0.1}, \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_mu_0.5} and \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_mu_0.5}), 
and such behavior is absent for large population sizes.

% We noticed unexpected behavior in presence of violation in $\bm{\mu}$: 
% figures \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_mu_0.1}, \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_mu_0.1}, \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_mu_0.5} and \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_mu_0.5} 
% show that the lines representing distance of population to limits $\bm{p}^\ast$ and $\bm{q}^\ast$ overlap. 
% The graphs suggest that finite population evolution is exploring a plane equidistant from $\bm{p}^\ast$ and $\bm{q}^\ast$.

% Moreover, in figures \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_mu_0.1} and \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_mu_0.1}, infinite population oscillation dies out to 
% give graph of single line. But infinite population is converging to limit $\bm{z}^\ast$. 
% This suggests $\bm{z}^\ast$ may be somewhere in equidistant plane from $\bm{p}^\ast$ and $\bm{q}^\ast$.

Figure \ref{vio_mu_dist} summarizes the distance data from tables \ref{distanceMuHapEps0.01} through  
\ref{distanceMuDipEps0.5}. Distance data (between finite and infinite populations) are plotted for different $\ell$. 
Plots for different violation levels $\bm{\epsilon}$ are arranged in columns. 
Plots for haploid and diploid populations are arranged in two rows. With increase in $\ell$, 
distance moves closer to the single step distance. Since diploid effective  
string length is twice haploid string length, 
distance in diploid case moves closer to the single step distance than in haploid case. 
It is also noticeable that in the haploid case, 
the distance moves closer to the single step distance as $\bm{\epsilon}$ increases.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we violated the condition \ref{OscCond} for mutation, making 
the Markov chain representing finite population evolution regular,
and ensuring that infinite population trajectories 
have no periodic orbit. Our experiments show that finite population evolution 
continues to approximately oscillate for small values of $\bm{\epsilon}$. 
For such values of $\bm{\epsilon}$, finite population evolution might sometimes be 
unaware of violation in condition \ref{OscCond} because the probability of using 
the new mask (all 0s mask) is low, and 
if the new mask is not used, finite population behavior 
matches the behavior exhibited without the violation. 
As population size increases, better oscillations are observed. 
As string length increases, oscillation degrades 
and larger population sizes are required to observe good oscillation.
