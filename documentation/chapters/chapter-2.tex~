\chapter{Extending A Genetic Algorithm Model To The Diploid Case} \label{ch:GA model Diploid}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter describes a simple Markov model for evolution under the
influence of crossing over and mutation; it is a non-overlapping,
generational, infinite population model which assumes panmixia and no
selective pressure. This chapter contributes to the elegance and
simplicity of the abstract development and the demonstration that Vose's
infinite population model for Genetic Algorithms --- which is a
haploid model --- extends to the diploid case.

A basic syntactic model for haploid and diploid genomes is considered in the beginning and commented on its expressive power. Then the mechanics of how the next generation is obtained from the current generation are
defined abstractly in procedural terms, which serves to motivate the equations governing evolution.

Next evolution equations are developed --- corresponding to the
procedural description defining evolution --- for a population of
diploid genomes. Observations concerning the form and symmetry of
those equations directly lead to decoupling from the diploid case a
haploid model sufficient to determine evolutionary trajectories for
the diploid case.  The model is specialized to a context where
mask-based crossing over and mutation operators are used, leading to
Vose's infinite population model for Genetic Algorithms.  

\section{Model}
A haploid genome $g$ is defined syntactically as a length $\ell$
binary string.  A collection of $h$ chromosomes may be modeled by
partitioning $g$ into $h$ segments (of arbitrary lengths $\ell_1,
\ldots , \ell_h$; thus $\ell = \ell_1 + \cdots + \ell_h$).
Partitioning may be extended to chromosomes so as to interpret each as
a collection of genes.  If continued to the granularity of pairs of
bits, partitioning allows, for example, representing the four
possibilities Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine.

A diploid genome $\alpha = \langle \alpha_0, \alpha_1 \rangle$ is
likewise defined syntactically as a pair of length $\ell$ binary
strings.  Although simple, that syntax is flexible and possesses
significant modeling power by means of tailoring partitioning to
application.  We focus on the abstract level, considering the
evolution of a non-overlapping, generational, infinite population
model assuming panmixia and no selective pressure. Whether and how
partitioning is defined is orthogonal to the development.

Following Hardy \cite{Hardy1908}, the model $q^{n}$ at generation $n$
is a vector having for component $q_\alpha^n$ the prevalence of
diploid $\alpha\,$ (the probability of selecting $\alpha$ \nudge at
generation $n$, assuming unbiased selection).\footnote{The
  representation here is the conceptual equivalent of Hardy's model.}
Ordered diploid $\gamma = \langle \gamma_0, \gamma_1 \rangle$ is
produced for generation $n+1$ according to following procedural
description.

  Assuming independent selection events:
\begin{itemize}
\item From parent $\alpha$ --- selected with probability
  $q_\alpha^n$ --- obtain gamete $\gamma_0$
\item From parent $\beta$ --- selected with probability $q_\beta^n$
  --- obtain gamete $\gamma_1$
\end{itemize}
Following Gieringer \cite{Geiringer1944}, let the transmission
function $t_\alpha(g)$ be the probability that gamete $g$ is produced
from parental genome $\alpha$.  It follows from the above that the
equation determining the next generation $q^{n+1}$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{model0}
q_\gamma^{n+1} \; = \;
\sum_{\alpha} \, q_\alpha^n \, t_\alpha(\gamma_0) 
\sum_{\beta} \,q_\beta^n \, t_\beta(\gamma_1)\\[-.05in]
\end{equation}

It should be appreciated that the Mendelian \cite{Mendel1866} laws of
segregation\footnote{Alleles of a given locus segregate into separate
  gametes.} and independent assortment\footnote{Alleles of one gene
  sort into gametes independently of the alleles of another gene.}
need not be respected by the transmission function.


The right hand side of (\ref{model0}) is invariant under interchange
of the summation variables $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which is equivalent
to interchanging $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$.  This symmetry reflects
the fact that which haploid of $\gamma$ is designated as $\gamma_0$ is
arbitrary,\\[-.05in]
\[
q_{\langle \gamma_0, \gamma_1 \rangle}^{n+1} \; = \;
q_{\langle \gamma_1, \gamma_0 \rangle}^{n+1}\\[.1in]
\]
The model corresponding to (\ref{model0}) is low-level in the sense
that it regards $\langle \gamma_0, \gamma_1 \rangle$ and $\langle
\gamma_1, \gamma_0 \rangle$ as distinct when $\gamma_1 \neq \gamma_0$.
A higher-level model based on sets is easily obtained,
\[
q_{\{\gamma_0, \nudge \gamma_1\}} \; = \; \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
2 \nudge q_{\langle \gamma_0, \gamma_1 \rangle} & \mbox{ if $\gamma_0 \neq \gamma_1$}\\
\phantom{2 \nudge }q_{\langle \gamma_0, \gamma_1 \rangle} & \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.\\[.05in]
\]
which is in agreement with Hardy\cite{Hardy1908} (issues he considered
and results he obtained relating to invariant distributions for a
particular sort of transmission function are not here mentioned
because they are irrelevant to the purpose of this section).

\section{Reduction}

Evolution equation (\ref{model0}) may be reduced to the haploid case.
Its right hand side is the product of two summations; denote the first
by $p_{\gamma_0}^{n+1}$ and the second by $p_{\gamma_1}^{n+1}$ so that
\begin{equation}
\label{model1}
q_{\langle \gamma_0, \gamma_1 \rangle}^{n+1} \; = \;
p_{\gamma_0}^{n+1} \, p_{\gamma_1}^{n+1}\\[.05in]
\end{equation}
where for any haploid $\gamma_0$,
\begin{equation}
\label{model00}
p_{\gamma_0}^{n+1} \; = \;
\sum_{\alpha} \,q_\alpha^n \, t_\alpha(\gamma_0)
\end{equation}
It suffices to determine the evolution of the distributions $p^{n}$.
Uncoupling \nudge $p$ \nudge from \nudge $q$ \nudge using
(\ref{model00}), and equation (\ref{model1}) with superscript $n$ ---
instantiate the $n$ in (\ref{model1}) with $n-1$ --- yields the
evolution equation
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{model2}
p_{\gamma_0}^{n+1} & = &
\sum_{\alpha_0, \, \alpha_1} \, q_{\langle \alpha_0, \,\alpha_1 \rangle}^n \,
t_{\langle \alpha_0, \,\alpha_1 \rangle}(\gamma_0) \nonumber \\
& = &
\sum_{\alpha_0, \, \alpha_1} \, p_{\alpha_0}^n \, p_{\alpha_1}^n \,
t_{\langle \alpha_0, \,\alpha_1 \rangle}(\gamma_0) 
\end{eqnarray}
The $p^n$ are in fact distributions; summing equation
(\ref{model1}) with superscript $n$ yields
\[
1 \; = \; \sum_\alpha \, q_\alpha^n \; = \;
\sum_{\alpha_0, \, \alpha_1} \, p_{\alpha_0}^n \, p_{\alpha_1}^n \; = \;
\Big( \sum_{\alpha_0} \, p_{\alpha_0}^n \Big)^2
\]
Let $[\mbox{\em expression\/} ]$ denote $1$ if {\em expression\/} is
true, and $0$ otherwise.\footnote{$[ \cdots ]$ is sometimes referred to
  as an {\em Iverson bracket}.}  The weighted count of haploid
$g$ in generation $n$ is
\begin{eqnarray*}
  & &
  \sum_{\alpha_0, \, \alpha_1} \, q_{\langle \alpha_0, \alpha_1 \rangle}^n
([g = \alpha_0] + [g = \alpha_1]) \\ & = &
\sum_{\alpha_0, \, \alpha_1} \, p_{\alpha_0}^n \, p_{\alpha_1}^n [g = \alpha_0] + 
\sum_{\alpha_0, \, \alpha_1} \, p_{\alpha_0}^n \, p_{\alpha_1}^n [g = \alpha_1] \\[0.05in]
& = & 2 \nudge p_g^n
\end{eqnarray*}
Hence the (normalized) prevalence of haploid $g$ in generation $n$ is
the $g\,$th component of the distribution $p^n$.

Evolution equation (\ref{model2}) in matrix form is
\begin{equation}
\label{model3}
p_g^\prime \; = \; p^T M_g \,\nudge p
\end{equation}
where current state $p$ (generation $n$) and next state $p^\prime$
(generation $n+1$) are column vectors, and the $g\,$th transmission
matrix is
\begin{equation} \label{Mg}
\Big(M_g \Big)_{u,v} \; = \; t_{\langle u, v \rangle}(g)
\end{equation}
(vectors and matrices are indexed by haploids --- length $\ell$ binary
strings).

\section{Specialization}

This section summarizes from the development in Vose \cite{Vose1999}.
It specializes the haploid evolution equations in the previous section
to Vose's infinite population model for Genetic Algorithms.  Whereas
in previous sections {\em component} referred to a component
of a distribution vector $q^n$ or $p^n$, in this section a component
is either a probability (when when speaking of a component of a
distribution vector), or a bit (when speaking of a component of a
haploid).

The set of haploids (i.e., length $\ell$ binary strings) is a
commutative ring $\mathcal{R}$ under component-wise addition and
multiplication modulo $2$.  This algebraic structure is crucial to
Vose's specialization and subsequent analysis of
(\ref{model3}). Denote the additive identity by ${\bf 0}$ and the
multiplicative identity by ${\bf 1}$, and let $\overline{g}$
abbreviate ${\bf 1} + g$.  Except when explicitly indicated otherwise,
operations acting on elements of $\mathcal{R}$ are as defined in this
paragraph.\footnote{In particular, $g \overline{g} = {\bf 0} = g+g$,
  $g^2 = g$, $g + \overline{g} = {\bf 1}$ for all $g \in
  \mathcal{R}$.}

The {\em mixing matrix\/} $M$ is
\[
M \; = \; M_{\bf 0}\\[-0.01in]
\]
So as to preserve the ability to endow abstract syntax with
specialized semantics, crossover\footnote{Crossover refers to crossing
  over.} and mutation are defined in a manner respecting arbitrary
partitioning (see section 2) and arbitrary linkage.  Groups of loci
can mutate and crossover with arbitrarily specified probabilities;
both mutation and crossover are defined in terms of distributions.  If
$g$ should mutate to $g^\prime$ with probability $\rho$,
let\\[-0.2in]
\[
\mu_{g + g^\prime} \; = \; \rho\\[0.05in]
\]
Given distribution $\mu$, mutation is the stochastic operator sending
$g$ to $g^\prime$ with probability $\mu_{g + g^\prime}$.  Following
Gieringer \cite{Geiringer1944}, if crossing over $u$ and $v$ should
produce $u^\prime$ and $v^\prime$ with probability $\rho$, let
\[
\chi_m \; = \; \rho
\]
where $m$ is $1$ at components which $u^\prime$ inherits from $u$, and
$0$ at components inherited from $v$.  It follows that\\[-0.3in]
\begin{eqnarray*}
u^\prime & = & m \nudge u + \overline{m} \nudge\nudge v \\
v^\prime & = & m \nudge v + \overline{m} \nudge\nudge u
\end{eqnarray*}
Given distribution $\chi$, crossover is the stochastic operator which
sends $u$ and $v$ to $u^\prime$ and $v^\prime$ with probability
$\chi_m$.

The probabilities comprising the components of the distributions $\mu$
and $\chi$ may be chosen however desired. It follows (see
\cite{Vose1999}) that the transmission function can be expressed in
the form
\begin{equation}
\label{transmission}
t_{\langle u,v \rangle}(g) \; = \;\,
\sum_{i \nudge \in \nudge \mathcal{R}} \, \sum_{j \nudge \in \nudge \mathcal{R}} \,
\sum_{k \nudge \in \nudge \mathcal{R}}
\mu_i \nudge \mu_j \, \frac{\chi_k + \chi_{\overline{k}}}{2} \,
[\nudge k (u + i) + \overline{k}(v + j) \, = \, g\nudge]
\end{equation}
\iffalse Here gamete $g$ is produced via mutation and then crossover
(which are operators that commute) and is as likely to be $u^\prime$
as it is to be $v^\prime$. The combined action of mutation and
crossover is referred to as {\em mixing}.  \fi Here gamete $g$ is
produced via mutation and then crossover (which are operators that
commute). The combined action of mutation and crossover is referred to
as {\em mixing}.  The mixing matrix $M$ is a fundamental object,
because (\ref{transmission}) implies that evolution equation
(\ref{model3}) can be expressed in the form
\begin{equation}
\label{model4}
p_g^\prime \; = \; (\sigma_g \nudge p)^T M \, (\sigma_g \nudge p)
\end{equation}
where the permutation matrix $\sigma_g$ is defined by component
equations
\[
(\sigma_g)_{u,v} \; = \; [\nudge u+v = g\nudge ]
\]
