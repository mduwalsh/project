An infinite population model is considered for diploid evolution under the influence of crossing over
and mutation. The evolution equations show how Vose's 
haploid model for Genetic Algorithms extends to the diploid case, thereby making feasible simulations
which otherwise would require excessive resources. This is illustrated through computations confirming
the convergence of finite diploid population short-term behaviour to the behaviour predicted by the
infinite diploid model. The results show the distance between finite and infinite population evolutionary trajectories can 
decrease in practice like the reciprocal of the square root of population size. 

Under necessary and sufficient conditions concerning mutation and crossover, 
infinite populations show oscillating behavior. 
We explore whether finite populations can also exhibit oscillation or approximate oscillation. 
Simulation results confirm that approximate finite population oscillation is possible. 

We also investigate the robustness of finite population oscillation.  
Finite populatoin evolution is modeled by a Markov chain. Necessary and sufficient conditions 
for inifinite population oscillation concern mutation and crossover. 
We show that when the condition converning mutation is violated, 
the Markov chain is regular, and perfect osciilation in 
finite population evolution should not osccur.
However, our simulation results show finite population exhibit 
approximate oscillating behavior even though the condition is violated.
