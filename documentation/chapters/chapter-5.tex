\chapter{Violation in Crossover Distribution} \label{ch:chiviolation}
The crossover distribution $\bm{\chi}$ was modified as
\[
\bm{\chi}_i = (1-\bm{\epsilon}) \bm{\chi}_i\, ; \tabspace i = \{1, 2,.., 2^{\ell}-1\} 
\]
So that 
\[
\bm{\chi}_i + \bm{\chi}_{i+g} = 1-\bm{\epsilon} ; \tabspace g \text{ is defined in  section } \ref{Limits}
\]

Then $j$ is chosen where $\bm{\chi}_j = 0$ and set $\bm{\chi}_j = \bm{\epsilon}$. 

Violation in crossover distribution $\bm{\chi}$ is different from violation in mutation distribution $\bm{\mu}$. 
Markov chain formed by transition matrix $Q$ is regular under violation in $\bm{\mu}$ but that is not the case under violation in  $\bm{\chi}$. 
Markov chain formed under violation in $\bm{\chi}$ may not be regular unless at least there are two $1$s in $g$.

With $\bm{\chi}$ described above, non-crossover mask (all 0s) has always positive probability. 
And since we do not modify the mutation distribution $\bm{\mu}$ satisfying condition \ref{OscCond}, 
the non-mutation mask (all 0s) has always zero probability. 
However, applying same mutation mask twice with non-crossover event, 
we can achieve non mutation event in two generations. 

% Let us exlore for two cases of $g$ in \ref{OscCond}:
% 
% 1. When $g$ is all $1$s:\newline
% Any mask with a $1$ at position $k$ ($0 \leq k < \ell$) and $0$ at all other positions can mutate the $k$th bit of a string.  In next step, 
% either the string can mutate its next bit or the string can simulate non-mutation event in two generations (mutate $j$th bit twice). 
% This makes possibile for any string to mutate to 
% any other string. And any string can maintain its bits in even number of generations after aquiring its state. 
% 
% 2. When $g$ has atleast one $0$:\newline
% Any mask with a $1$ at position $k$ and $0$ at all other positions  
% will have positive probability if $g$ also is $1$ at position $k$. 
% Thus any bit where $g$ is $1$ can mutate.  
% Any mask with $1$ in just one of the positions where $g$ has $1$s and 
% also $1$ in just one of the positions where $g$ has $0$s can be used to 
% mutate a bit where $g$ is $0$ using two masks in sequence. 
% So any string can mutate to any other. 
% Also any string requires two generations to simulate non-mutation event. 

Any mask with a $1$ at position $k$ and $0$ at all other positions  
will have positive probability if $g$ also is $1$ at position $k$. 
Thus any bit where $g$ is $1$ can mutate. 

1. Mutate a bit in string where $g$ has $0$: 
Any mask with $1$ in just one of the positions where $g$ has $1$s and 
also $1$ in just one of the positions where $g$ has $0$s can be used to 
mutate a bit where $g$ is $0$ using these two masks in sequence in two steps. 

2.
Any bit in a string at position where $g$ 
is $1$ can be mutated in two steps. 

So any string can mutate to any other in even number of steps. 
Also any string requires two generations to simulate non-mutation event.
So any population can therefore mutate to any other population in even number of generations, 
and that makes the Markov chain irreducible.

In this research, experiment is designed to have finite population size as multiple of 2. 
So, there is a special set of population $P_s$ which can mutate to itself, i.e. one string in 
population can mutate to another string in population maintaining same population member strings within. 
Since any population can mutate to any other population, let us assume finite population $P_i$ 
can reach special population $P_s$ in $u$ (even) generations. Population $P_s$ can stay in its state as long as its wants 
by mutating to itself or mutate to next population state. Population $P_s$ can return to $P_i$ next $u$ generations. 
Let's say $P_s$ stays as $P_s$ for $h$ generations. Then population $P_i$ can return to its original state $P_i$ 
in total $2u+h$ generations. $h$ can be $1, \; 2, \;, 3,$ and so on. That means $P_i$ can return to its original state in 
odd or even number of generations. So, the Markov chain is also aperiodic.

Since the Markov chain formed by GA after the violation in $\bm{\chi}$ is irreducible and aperiodic, 
the Markov chain is regular (see \cite{Iosifescu1980}), and a steady state distribution 
with positive components exists for the GA (see \cite{Minc1988}). 

Simulations are repeated with violation levels $\bm{\epsilon}$ as above.
The distances of both infinite and finite populations to limit $\bm{z}^\ast$ are plotted. 
The distances of both infinite and finite populations to non-violation limits $\bm{p}^\ast$ and $\bm{q}^\ast$ are also plotted.

\section{Discussion}

In oscillation of population in presence of violation (in either case $\bm{\mu}$ or $\bm{\chi}$), 
as value of $\ell$ increases, amplitude of oscillation decreases. 
Populations with larger population size, show better oscillations. 
Since diploid population consists of string length twice the size of string length of hapliod population, 
diploid population needs larger population size than haploid population to exhibit good oscillations. 
In both cases of violation in $\bm{\mu}$ and $\bm{\chi}$, for diploid population, increasing string length $\ell$ 
degrades convergence (as finite population size increases) to infinite population behavior. The behavior is noticable in figures 
\ref{oscillation_8d_vio_mu_0.01} through \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_mu_0.1} for violation in $\bm{\mu}$, 
and in figures \ref{oscillation_8d_vio_chi_0.01} through \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_chi_0.1} for violation in $\bm{\chi}$. 
The behavior is less noticable in haploid population.

With increase in value of $\bm{\epsilon}$, 
oscillation in population diminishes, and oscillation completely ceases after certain threshold value for $\bm{\epsilon}$. 
Comparing oscillation with violation in $\bm{\mu}$ and $\bm{\chi}$, rate of dampening of oscillation with violation 
in $\bm{\chi}$ looks to be less than with violation in ${\bm{\mu}}$, 
and so we see some oscillation even for $\bm{\epsilon} = 0.5$ for haploid population in this case. 
Diploid populations jumping to other levels 
were observed for string length $\ell$ of values 12 and 14 for population size of 4096 in 
figures \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_chi_0.01}, \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_chi_0.01}, \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_chi_0.1}, 
\ref{oscillation_14d_vio_chi_0.1}, \ref{oscillation_12d_vio_chi_0.5} and \ref{oscillation_14d_vio_chi_0.5}, 
but unlike in case of violation in $\bm{\mu}$, the behavior is not completely absent when population size was larger. 
Random wiggles are seen in populations with larger population size also for $\ell$ = 12 and 14. 
Jumping to other levels are observed for string length $\ell = 10$ when population size is 4096 in figures \ref{oscillation_10d_vio_chi_0.01} 
and \ref{oscillation_10d_vio_chi_0.01}.
For $\ell = 10$, random wiggles are 
noticeable for larger population also when $\bm{\epsilon}$ value is increased to $0.5$ (see figure \ref{oscillation_10d_vio_chi_0.5}).

Figures \ref{vio_mu_dist} and \ref{vio_chi_dist} summarizes the distance data from tables \ref{distanceMuHapEps0.01} $\cdots$ 
\ref{distanceChiDipEps0.5}. Distance of infinite population from finite population of 
three finite population sizes {4096, 40960, 81920} are plotted for different $\ell$. 
Plots for different violation levels $\bm{\epsilon}$ are arranged in columns. 
Plots for haploid and diploid populations are arranged in two rows. With increase in $\ell$, 
distance moves closer to the single step distance. So, since diploid population 
string length is twice of haploid population, 
distance in diploid case moves closer to the single step distance than in haploid case. 
It is also noticable in haploid population case that as $\bm{\epsilon}$ increases, 
the distance moves closer to the single step distance.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we violated the condition \ref{OscCond} through violation in mutation and crossover distribution, and 
studied infinite and finite populations oscillation behavior with the violation through experiments. 
Infinite population ceases to oscillate when the condition \ref{OscCond} for convergence to 
periodic orbits is violated, but finite population continued to approximately oscillate for small values of $\bm{\epsilon}$. 
For smaller values of $\bm{\epsilon}$, finite population does not get aware of violation because the probability of using 
new mask created in the mutation distribution $\bm{\mu}$ and the crossover distribution $\bm{\mu}$ due to violation is very low, and 
if no new mask is used, finite population follows behavior of infinite population without violation in the condition for convergence to 
periodic orbits.
