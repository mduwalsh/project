\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I thank Michael D. Vose, Hairong Qi, and Judy D. Day for serving as my committee members. 
I am especially grateful to my academic advisor Michael D. Vose for suggesting the topic of this
research and for giving so generously of his time. I have
utterly enjoyed our many hours of discussion related to this thesis 
and learned a lot from this.

This research would not be complete without support of Sergey Gavrilets 
from Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,
who funded most of my graduate tuition through assistantship, 
and also provided access to the computing cluster Volos for running simulations.
I wish to thank Sergey Gavrilets for his support. 

Finally, I wish to thank my family, 
especially cousin Reshma for putting up some encouraging words. 
Sometimes they had more belief in me than I had in myself.
